# Sprite Manipulation in Java

This project shows an example of an animated sprite control in Java.

## Introduction

This projet is based on the article [**"Ultimate Java Image Manipulation"**](https://www.javalobby.org//articles/ultimate-image/) by Josiah Hester. But there ar some differences between this implementation and the original implementation:

 - In the original source, the sprite is directly drawn into the _JFrame_. In this project, the sprite is drawn into a _JPanel_, that is inside the _JFrame_;
 - The original sprite doesn't move inside the screen, only changes its animation. In this project, it moves inside the screen, using the keyboard;
 - The current project were divided into a MVC model (_model-control-view_) allowing easy maintenance.
